        I started my career as a child psychiatrist and a researcher 25 years ago. I was interested not only in biological basis of mental disorders, but in psychotherapy and the concept of change. Upon immigration to the US, I studied among influential psychiatrists and therapists in New York and Boston. Currently I work in inpatient and outpatient settings, supervise medical students, and conduct psychiatric research. As I have been for the past 25 years, I am still fascinated with the amazing, complex process of individual development.

        There are thousands of things can go wrong with parent and their child. Modern neuroscience is in the process of identifying and resolving these issues. I feel privileged to be in the center of that movement and share my knowledge and skills with my colleges and patients.
